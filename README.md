## Introduction

It is a chatbot built with `Node JS` webhook server, it uses Dialogflow functionality to answer the end user query which it receives from twilio.

## How to use it

Send a WhatsApp message to `+1 415 523 8886` containing code `join cream-buffalo`

## What we are achieving to do

A chatbot can communicate with a real person behaving like a human. You can create chatbots for any business the same as you recruit a person for any department of your company. Similarly this chatbot can do several things for you. Its purpose is to create an advance bot which doesn't require whatsapp user to keep changing the tabs to do things. The bot can download tv serials, songs, movies, books from YouTube or any other website.

## Unique Features

- Direct Download videos/tv serials/books via link
- Can search Github repository for the end user
- Can search YouTube video
- Get celebrities' biography

## What is our goal

Our goal is to create an advance bot which can do things for the whatsapp user. Our future goal is to get this project on advance level, we will add aforementioned features soon. We will add new features for `Github` by using GitHub API and also add the functionality to download YouTube videos to mp3 and in any video format. A user can also be able to download the whole `PDF` file containing biography of that celebrity.
