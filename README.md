Introduction:

It is a chatbot built with node js webhook server, it uses Dialogflow functionality to answer the end user query which it recieves from twilio. 

What we are achieving to do:

A chatbot can communicate with a real person behaving like a human. You can create chatbots for any business the same as you recruit a person for any department of your company.
Similarly this chatbot can do several things for you. Its purpose is to create an advance bot who doesn't require whatsapp user to keep changing the tabs to do things. Tha bot can download tv serials, songs, movies, books from youtube or any other websites.

Unique Functionalities:

Direct Download videos/tv serials/books via link
Can search git repository for the end user
Can search youtube video
Get celebrities biography


What is our goal:

Our goal is to create an advance bot who can do things for the whatsapp user.
Our future goal is to get this project on advance level, we will add these features soon..

We add new features for git by using github api
We will add the functionality to download youtube videos to mp3 and in any video format also
